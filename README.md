# DataKliq-Project
The Beginning of my Excel Dashboard Journey with DataKliq.
This project was offered to us an Assignment by the tutors.
Report Covid 19 data that revolves around confirmed cases, recovery and death cases.
Identify countries with the highest confirmed cases, recoveries and death cases.
Â 
The data was acquired from John Hopkin University, USA.
The dataset used contains confirmed cases, death and recovery from various countries ranging from 2020-2022
This analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel. Firstly, Power Query was used to clean, transform and merge the datasets.
Pivot tables were used to simplify the datasets and perform calculations as Charts were used to visualize the data.
